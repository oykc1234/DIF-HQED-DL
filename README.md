DIF-HQED-DL: Digital Inclusive Finance and High-Quality Enterprise Development using Deep Learning
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the research paper titled:
"Integrating Traditional Two-way Fixed-effects Models with KAN and GCN-Enhanced Deep Learning Models: Exploring the Impact of Digital Inclusive Finance on High-Quality Development of Enterprise"
submitted to Scientific Reports.

The study explores the relationship between Digital Inclusive Finance (DIF) and High-Quality Enterprise Development (HQED), particularly focusing on Total Factor Productivity (TFPLP). By combining traditional economic models (two-way fixed-effects) with advanced deep learning techniques (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)), this research provides a novel methodology for capturing the complex nonlinear relationships between DIF and TFPLP.
